# DFT-calculations
This repo is made for performing density functional theory calculations.

Density Functional Theory calculations are performed to assesss the optoelectronics properties of a species. 
Through these calculations , we theoritically evaluate the feasibility of a species to be a suitable qubit and for other quantum applications.
