# DFT-calculations
This repo is made for performing density functional theory calculations.

Density Functional Theory calculations are performed to assesss the optoelectronics properties of a species. 
Through these calculations , we theoritically evaluate the feasibility of a species to be a suitable qubit and for other quantum applications.
The software used is Quantum Espresso. The folders contain the necessary files for calculations and also the resuting density of states plot as well as the band gap plot for the species.
